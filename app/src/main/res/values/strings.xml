    <string name="fish_tanks">Fish Tanks</string>
    <string name="aquaponics_systems_">Aquaponics systems begin with fish tanks, where aquatic species such as tilapia, trout, or catfish are raised. The fish produce waste (ammonia) as a byproduct of their metabolism, which accumulates in the water.</string>
    <string name="grow_beds">Grow Beds</string>
    <string name="the_nutrient_rich_w">The nutrient-rich water from the fish tanks is then circulated to grow beds, which contain plants.

    <string name="fish_and_plant_selection">Fish and Plant Selection</string>
    <string name="the_choice_of_fish_">The choice of fish and plants depends on various factors such as climate, water temperature, and market demand. Warm-water fish like tilapia are commonly used in tropical climates, while cold-water species like trout are suitable for cooler regions. Leafy greens, herbs, tomatoes, and cucumbers are popular choices for aquaponic cultivation.</string>
    <string name="sustainability">Sustainability</string>
    <string name="aquaponics_is_an_">Aquaponics is an eco-friendly farming method that conserves water and resources compared to traditional agriculture.
